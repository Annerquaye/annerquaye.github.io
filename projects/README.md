# RICE STORY

In 2019, a local radio station launched a campaign to boost consumption of local rice.
Before then farmers could barely get market for their produce. 

## METHOD

In this analysis, I tracked market survey data to examine the impact of this campaign.
I used pandas to analyze price of local rice especially in Accra where the radio station is the most popular.
I benchmark the price to the second biggest city which is supposed to have a relatively cheaper cost of living due to proximity to farming towns.

## FINDINGS

My analysis revealed that few weeks after the campaign, price of local rice in Accra started dropping.
Eventually, it fell below the price in Kumasi.
