                        <p>By Richard A. Abbey
                        <p>
                    </strong>
                    <p>New York City is home to more than a million pets, according to various estimates. The vast
                        majority of these pets are either dogs or cats. While the exact population of pets in the Big
                        Apple is up for debate, the New York City Economic Development or NYCEDC estimate of 1.1 million
                        is widely referenced.</p>

                    <p>Besides canines and felines, some New Yorkers seem to have an affinity towards animals that are
                        outrightly outlawed to be kept as pets. Apart from issuing licenses to dog owners, the New York
                        City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene or DOHMH has a list of animals that are forbidden
                        to be kept as pets.</p>

                    <p>For starters, most farm animals cannot be kept as pets. The list of outlawed animals includes
                        wild animals like lions, kangaroos, ferrets, bees, and many others. The department's reasons for
                        listing some of these animals may seem obvious while others may not.</p>

                    <p>The city's 311 complaints system, a service established for New Yorkers to file complaints about
                        anything to city authorities, allows people to report illegal animals being kept as pets.
                        Alternatively, people who own these animals can drop them off at Animal Care Centers locations
                        across the city to avoid a violation.</p>

                    <p>An analysis of 311 complaints offers an insight into which of these animals are mostly reported
                        to city officials. The 311 data since 2010 identifies animals such as roosters, snakes, ferrets,
                        monkeys, and turtles among some of the oft-reported complaints.</p>

                    <p>There are several reasons why roosters are illegal. The obvious reason is the nuisance
                        they
                        create with their crowing. Rooster fighting is another reason why these animals are not
                        permitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>Cockfighting is a blood sport in which two roosters specifically bred for aggression are
                        placed
                        beak to beak in a small ring and encouraged to fight to the death.

                    <p>New York City has long considered ferrets as wild animals and generally banned them.

                    <p>In 1999, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani made it illegal for ferrets to be kept as
                        pets due to fear of rabies. There were also concerns that the furry creatures could attack
                        children.

                        <p>Why they are illegal:</p>
                    </strong>

                    <p>Iguanas, which belong to the reptile family, are venomous, although their venom may not
                        typically be as deadly as other siblings.
                    </p>
                    <p>The decision to ban these reptiles dates far back to the 90s when the Department of
                        Health
                        moved to ban hundreds of species of animals, including iguanas, from ownership.

                        <p>Why they are illegal:</p>
                    </strong>

                    <p>It's illegal to sell or distribute pet turtles with shells less than 4 inches long
                        because
                        they spread salmonella.
                    </p>
                    <p>Forty years ago, the U.S. outlawed the sale of tiny turtles as pets because they harbor
                        salmonella, a bacterium that causes a highly unpleasant and occasionally deadly illness
                        in
                        humans.

                    <p>Caveat</p>

                    <p>The 311 data showed that 513 complaints were made about Farm Animals but offered no
                        breakdown. Another set of complaints classified as "Other" had 847 total complaints;
                        again,
                        no breakdown was provided.
                    </p>
                    <p>Also, these complaints have not been filtered to remove instances of duplication of
                        complaints about the same incidents.
