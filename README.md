# Oscars Best Picture Picture in the last five years

This is a basic project that seeks to understand what's been happening to the Best Picture category at the Academy Awards over the last five years.

I started by scraping both winners and nominees of the category over the past five years. I scraped the their budgets and revenues from multiple sources such Box Office and IMDB.

I was also interested in their genre which I scraped from IMDB. I further scraped the production companies and the the distribution companies from other sources such as Wikipedia.

I used pandas to perform basic analysis such as grouping and displaying revenue against budgets. I used Google spreadsheets as well to create handy pivot tables that helped in the analysis.

I used datawrapper for visualization and used Google spreadsheet for another visualization.

## What I learned

The major lesson here is that sometimes all the data for a particular project are not necessarily in one place. Sometimes they could be all over the place and writing useful code could be much difficult than having to manually scrape it.

## What I wished I had done

I would have loved to have expanded the dataset so as to perform regression analysis that will help to predict possible outcomes of future winners of the Best Picture award.
